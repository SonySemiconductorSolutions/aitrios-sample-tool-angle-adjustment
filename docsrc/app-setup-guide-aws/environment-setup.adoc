== Environment Setup

This page provides instructions to setup the AAT Application in AWS Cloud.


- It is recommended to use link:https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview[GitHub Codespaces^] to set up AWS cloud environment. Alternatively, an Ubuntu machine will also work.
- Ensure that your host machine has access to AWS and that it can connect to the database port (Port: 5432).

[NOTE]
====
* Make sure to login to the AWS account in AWS CLI with sufficient permissions to create the resources.
* Refer following links to login to AWS CLI.

- link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html#cli-configure-files-methods[Sign in with a access key using AWS CLI^]

[NOTE]
====
By default the Admin App user session is maintained for 1440 minutes, if it is to be changed, please make an edit in `tools/cloud-setup/aws/source-build.sh`. Check for the field DEFAULT_JWT_EXPIRED_MINUTES and update the value in minutes.
====

* Before starting the AWS Cloud Setup, make sure to delete all terraform related files (from previous cloud setup if any).  +
- tools/cloud-setup/aws/.terraform
- tools/cloud-setup/aws/.terraform.lock.hcl
- tools/cloud-setup/aws/terraform.tfstate
- tools/cloud-setup/aws/tfplan
- tools/cloud-setup/aws/terraform.tfstate.backup

* Execute the `cloud-setup.sh` to create cloud instance in AWS. Cloud Instance creation may take around 15 minutes.

[source,shell]
