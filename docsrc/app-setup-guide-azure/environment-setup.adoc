== Environment Setup

This page provides instructions to setup the AAT Application in Cloud.


- It is recommended to use link:https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/overview[GitHub Codespaces^] to set up Azure cloud environment. Alternatively, an Ubuntu machine will also work.
- Ensure that your host machine has access to Azure and that it can connect to the database port (Port: 1443).
